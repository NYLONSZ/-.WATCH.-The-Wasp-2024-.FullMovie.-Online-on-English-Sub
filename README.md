If you're wondering how and where you can watch The Wasp this weekend, take a look at the info above

The biggest movie of the Summer is almost here, with The Wasp set to bring two of Marvel's biggest icons to the Marvel Cinematic Universe. A first of its kind for Marvel Studios, the R-rated comedy will bring Wade Wilson (Ryan Reynolds) and Logan Howlett (Hugh Jackman) to the MCU, with the two sharing the screen for the first time ever. Yep. First time ever. They definitely haven't met before in a movie called X-Men Origins: Wolverine. That'd be wacky.

At the end of Deadpool 2, Wade plays around with time to revive his beloved girlfriend Vanessa (Morena Baccarin) and his X-Force teammates. However, what Wade didn't expect was to get the attention of the Time Variance Authority (first seen in Disney+'s Loki), and they recruited both him and a particularly depressed Wolverine to save the multiverse from Cassandra Nova (Emma Corrin). Marvel hasn't had a multiversal event this big since Spider-Man: No Way Home, so you better believe Marvel fans across the globe are primed and ready to see their favorite mutants return to the screen. To find out when and how you can watch this chimichanga-filled buddy cop adventure, here is where you can watch The Wasp.

The Wasp Releases In Theaters On July 26, 2024

Available In Several Premium Formats, The exclusive theatrical release of The Wasp begins on July 26, 2024. It is the MCU's first R-rated movie, which means that anyone under the age of 17 is required to be accompanied by an adult if watching The Wasp in theaters. This rating is largely due to the no-holds-barred violence that typifies Deadpool's cinematic career, but strong language and sexual references are also to be expected.

The movie has a runtime of 2 hours and 7 minutes and features one post-credits scene. This makes it the longest Deadpool movie to date, with Deadpool coming in at 1 hour 48 minutes and Deadpool 2 hitting 1 hour and 59 minutes. The Wasp is available to watch in IMAX, 4DX, and other premium formats, which promise to deliver the full impact of seeing the heroes engaging in the MCU's most brutal fight sequences.

The Wasp Cast:

The Wasp was written by Ryan Reynolds, Rhett Reese, Paul Wernick, Zeb Wells, and Shawn Levy. It was directed by Shawn Levy and stars the following actors: Ryan Reynolds as Wade Wilson/Deadpool Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine Emma Corrin as Cassandra Nova Morena Baccarin as Vanessa Rob Delaney as Peter Leslie Uggams as Blind Al Karan Soni as Dopinder Matthew Macfadyen as Mr. Paradox

The Wasp Streaming Release Date?

The Wasp will eventually be released on Disney+, rather than Netflix or Max, as the movie is produced and distributed by Disney. Disney has yet to announce a streaming release date for The Wasp. The three latest MCU movies to hit streaming — The Marvels, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, and Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania — all came to Disney+ 89 days after their theatrical debuts. Should the distributor follow suit here, The Wasp would come to Disney+ on October 23.

Is 'The Wasp' in Theaters?

Yes, The Wasp will be a big-screen adventure well-suited for two of Marvel's most beloved characters. The hugely anticipated team-up won't have to tangle with too much competition that weekend, though the disaster film sequel Twisters did storm into theaters a week earlier. The week after The Wasp, the film will then be sharing theater space with M. Night Shyamalan's new thriller Trap, Colman Domingo's Oscar hopeful Sing Sing, and Zachary Levi's children's book adaptation Harold and the Purple Crayon.

Watch the Trailer for 'The Wasp'?

The release of The Wasp may be just around the corner, but Marvel dropped one more special look at the upcoming film just a week before the big premiere day. Apart from a quick reference to Spider-Man at the end, the final trailer is a big departure from the previous trailers by focusing much more on the emotional core of both Deadpool and Wolverine. However, that's not why this trailer has gotten people talking. Not only does it give us a proper look at Lady Deadpool (who is rumored to be played by Ryan Reynolds' real-life wife Blake Lively), but the trailer confirms that Dafne Keen will indeed be reprising her role as Logan's surrogate daughter, X-23, last seen in the film Logan.

When Will The Wasp Release On Streaming?

The Wasp Will Stream On Disney Plus. There is no official word on when The Wasp will be available to stream. As it is officially part of the MCU, it will almost certainly be exclusively available on Disney Plus later this year, which currently houses the vast majority of MCU productions and the movies that were once part of Fox's X-Men franchise. The biggest likelihood is that The Wasp will be available on Disney's streamer around this year's holiday season, since this is typically peak time for streaming as audiences keep indoors.

The Wasp has generated an incredible level of hype, and will likely remain in theaters for as long as possible as it sticks the landing with critics. This is even more possible given that it will be the only MCU movie of 2024, leaving the road wide open until Captain America: Brave New World releases on February 14, 2025. With that in mind, Marvel Studios will likely want to capitalize on the box office revenue of The Wasp for as long as possible, possibly even relishing in the latest billion-dollar MCU movie.

When Will The Wasp Release On Digital , DVD & BLU-Ray?

Before The Wasp is available to stream with a subscription to Disney Plus, it will be available to buy/rent and download digitally via VOD services likely at a price between $15 - $20. Again, Marvel Studios has yet to confirm a date when The Wasp will release digitally on home media, though it will probably be around Fall 2024, and September at the earliest. This format should come with behind-the-scenes featurettes and other extra features like gag reels, though the full details of what it will contain has to be confirmed.

Where To Watch The Wasp Online Free Streaming?

As of now, the only way to watch The Wasp is to head out to a movie theater when it releases on Friday, September 8. You can find a local showing on Fandango.

The Wasp is still currently in theaters if you want to experience all the film’s twists and turns in a traditional cinema. But there’s also now an option to watch the film at home. As of November 25, 2024, The Wasp is available on HBO Max. Only those with a subscription to the service can watch the movie. Because the film is distributed by 20th Century Studios, it’s one of the last films of the year to head to HBO Max due to a streaming deal in lieu of Disney acquiring 20th Century Studios, as Variety reports. At the end of 2024, 20th Century Studios’ films will head to Hulu or Disney+ once they leave theaters.

Disney typically releases its films on Disney+ around 45-60 days after their theatrical release, ensuring an immersive cinematic experience for viewers.

Is The Wasp on Amazon HBO Max?

The Wasp movie could eventually be available to watch on HBO Max, though it will likely be a paid digital release rather than being included with an HBO Max subscription. This means that rather than watching the movie as part of an existing subscription fee, you may have to pay money to rent the movie digitally on HBO Max. However, Warner Bros. and HBO Max have yet to discuss whether or not this will be the case.
